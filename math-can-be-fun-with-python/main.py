# In a print function, divide 60 by 23
print(60/23)

# In a second print() function, write the arithmetic operators to multiply 20 times 3 plus 18
print(20*3+18)

#  Assign a variable called pay equal to 3800 and another variable named expenses equal to 2200
pay = 3800
expenses = 2200

#  Write another print() function. Inside the function subtract expenses from pay
print(pay-expenses)
